# Haskell Language
What is Haskell?
* Completley functional language
* Static typing with type inference 
* Can do anything that an imperative language can do
    * But like any language, it's better at some things than others
* Absolutely nothing like you've ever seen before

## Types
As mentioned before, Haskell is  Statically typed like C++ or Java, but the way that types are used in Haskell is very different than in any C-ish language.

For example, here is a type declaration in C++ :

```c++ 
int num;
float num_2 = 9;
int *list = new int[30];

int squred (int a )
{
    return a*a;
}
```
